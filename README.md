📌 CodeAplha_tasks

Welcome to CodeAplha_tasks — a collection of Jupyter Notebook projects focused on data analysis, visualization, and sentiment analysis.

This repository contains three individual projects created using Python and data science libraries like pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and NLP tools. Each project demonstrates hands‑on work with real datasets and analytical techniques.

📁 Projects Included
1. CodeAlpha – Data Visualization

A project focused on visualizing datasets to discover patterns and insights.

Description:
Creates visual plots such as bar charts, scatter plots, histograms, heatmaps, etc., using popular Python visualization libraries. Helps in understanding data distributions and correlations.

Key Concepts:

Exploratory data visualization

Chart interpretation

Use of libraries like matplotlib, seaborn, plotly

Files:

Jupyter Notebooks containing code for different visualizations

How to Use:

Install dependencies

Open notebook

Run all cells to view visual outputs

2. CodeAlpha – Exploratory Data Analysis

A notebook performing in‑depth exploration of a dataset.

Description:
This EDA project includes data cleaning, summary statistics, missing value treatment, feature inspection, and basic inference. Aimed at understanding dataset characteristics before modeling or decision‑making.

Key Concepts:

Data cleaning

Summary statistics (mean, median, mode)

Missing value handling

Feature correlation analysis

Files:

EDA Jupyter Notebook

How to Use:

Load the dataset

Run cell by cell to explore data insights

3. Lexicon‑Sentiment‑Analysis‑Master

A sentiment analysis project using lexicon‑based techniques.

Description:
Implements sentiment analysis on text data using lexicon approaches like VADER or TextBlob. Evaluates text polarity (positive, negative, neutral) and visualizes sentiment distributions.

Key Concepts:

Text preprocessing (tokenization, cleaning)

Lexicon‑based sentiment scoring

Sentiment distribution plotting

Files:

Notebook for preprocessing and sentiment scoring

How to Use:

Load the text dataset

Preprocess text (clean, normalize)

Run sentiment scoring

Analyze results and charts
